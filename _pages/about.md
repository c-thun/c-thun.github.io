I am Aakash Kapoor, an Electrical Engineering Graduate from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering. You may find my resume attached at the bottom of this page as a PDF file. My interests are what drive me to do whatever I do and at the current time, they are aligned with Web Development, Deep Learning, Quantum Computing courses and the French language.

I am an avid blogger and you can find my blogs at the following places -
* [Prepsera](https://prepsera.wordpress.com) : A blog for guiding students to help them score better in multiple competetive examinations
* [Think](https://dualbootlife.wordpress.com) : This is a slightly different blog wherein me and two of my friends post poetry, prose and our thoughts and opinions on things that make you reflect about life

I am a big fan of the Free and Open Source Software movement and prefer to not only make but also use FOSS Softwares. If you would like to collaborate on any interesting Open Source project, do feel free to [contact me](/contact).
