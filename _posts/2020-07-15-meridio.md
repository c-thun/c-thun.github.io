Meridio was a learning project I took upon as a way to get better at developing React Native. The goal was to be able to create a file sharing app using Android's File Sharing API *(not the Nearby Sharing API)* and providing it for friends to use. However, somewhere between the project, two things happened : My second laptop stopped working and Google officially released Nearby Share. The first prevented me from being able to actually test the app's sharing functionality while the second removed any reason for the app to actually be there. After all, it wasn't supposed to be a commercial project or anything and only as a way to learn React Native. 

However, it ended up being a much more rewarding experience than the first paragraph would lead you to believe. Not only was it fun to implement a beautiful UI in React Native but it was also really amazing to see a well-implemented Redux based data flow architecture which helped provide instant data updation and availability throughout the app. From the point of view of the original purpose, learning, Meridio has been a success. Is it a fully finished app? No, and that's because of reliability issues with Android's File Sharing API. Do I know React Native and Redux well now? Yes, and it's much easier for me to work now on React Native apps thanks to Meridio. 

If you would like to help me complete the project by helping fix the File Sharing API (or my implementation/usage of it) reliability issues, I would be more than delighted. You may find the code in the ![Meridio Repository](https://github.com/c-thun/meridio)
