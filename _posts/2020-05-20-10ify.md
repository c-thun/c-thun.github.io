What started off as an idea to save time turned into a script that could be shared to help new users ease into their brand new Linux desktops.With an almost 90% market share in the desktop operating system category, Windows is ubiquitous with desktop computing. This has led to a lot of people who love the Windows workflow but want to try out Linux, for its merits or their personal choice.

This project is aimed at these people to reduce their barrier for entry to Linux by providing them a quick and painless method for obtaining the same workflow they loved on their Windows machines despite using Linux. Unlike other similar projects, this differs as it changes much more settings that add ti the little finishing touches which make the experience.

This project is aimed at the users of the GNOME Desktop Environment and works out of the box for Ubuntu, Fedora, PopOS and Debian. The project sees regular updates in line with the updates to the latest versions of the GNOME extensions that this script makes use of. Unlike other similar projects, it also includes an uninstaller to help quikcly revert changes made by the script.
