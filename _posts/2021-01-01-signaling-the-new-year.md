2020 certainly has been an experience. It's been tragic, it's been chaotic, and even downright ugly at certain times. Now it doesn't matter where you lean, which side you take, how you think, and who you are but we can agree that the last year has been eye-opening, to say the least. So while the news keeps getting more and more depressing, I'm here to spread some post-holiday cheer. 

Okay, maybe not spreading cheer per se but I certainly want to look at the positives of last year. It simply isn't possible for everything to be just dark and sad all the time *(Even by definition, really. Happiness/Sadness, etc. are all relative terms so one can't exist without the other)*. So what good came out of 2020? I don't know about you but I have a lot of little good things that made my lockdown days happy... 

Like developing a complete app for the first time, or switching away from wordpress built sites to actually coding my sites, or how about learning French, or how about discovering a hidden talent for photography... The list goes on. The point is, even in the darkest of years, your actions have the power to bring cheer and warmth to your days. And so, as I wrap this fairly pointless article up, just remember the above anecdote as a moral. If someday it helps you bring cheer to sad times, I will feel more than successful for having helped a fellow human smile. 

With this, I hope we have a better year ahead of us. Although my hopes keep fading, my desires for every year stay unchanged. I wish the world becomes a cheerier, less divided, and more patient place. I wish people would engage more in civil discussion, arguing their stances with facts and rationality, and not in destructive wars. I wish more people have access to plentiful food, clean water, adequate healthcare and holistic education. And regardless of whether these wishes come true or not, I wish we keep working to make the world a better place. 

Happy New Year, everyone.
