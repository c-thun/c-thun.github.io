With large chat groups, there is always a problem of having too many status update messages, especially with Telegram as they allow large groups to be setup. The notifications I am talking about are of the form : New user added, Admin changed, User left group, etc. Thanks to the Telegram API, however, there is a cure.

This open-source bot, once added to any Telegram group and made an admin, will auto-clean all such subsequent messages almost instantly to prevent your group chats from being cluttered. Do keep in mind that for this bot to work, it must be deployed on any server (as is the case with all Telegram bots)

You can check out the code for Thread Cleaner Bot [here](https://github.com/c-thun/ThreadCleanerBot) and make use of it as you will.
