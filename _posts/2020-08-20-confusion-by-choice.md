To be or not to be, that is the question *(Source: [Hamlet, by William Shakespeare](https://amzn.to/3iiipFi))*. This neat statement, despite being quite small, manages to convey through it one of the biggest problems that have plagued humanity through the annals of history : the problem of choice. Without choice, we are bound in our actions; with too much choice, we are stagnant in our actions and bound by confusion. There is no victory in either of these two extremes and the only pragmatic way forward is to choose the middle ground.

The Free Software Movement is a remarkable pursuit of providing users with control and power, relegating software into the role of a tool to be used by the users. It should be obvious that this makes the Free Software Movement extremely political in spirit. As it proposes radical freedoms of choice, it becomes not only a challenge to uphold it but to also follow it. In addition, as it liberates users and developers to tinker and fiddle with their machines to their hearts content, it leads to the extremely annoying side effect of too much to choose from. In some way, it is like a democracy : chaotic, vibrant with multitudes of views, and extremely empowering.  This is ensured and protected by the usage of open licensing models like GPL and AGPL. 

By giving power to individuals, everyone gets an opportunity to make their voices and opinions heard. Users are free to choose whatever combination of software they feel like, participate in the coding process and submit patches/fixes/modifications to steer the software development process in the direction they would like it to go. If unable to contribute to big projects *(because of any reason)*, users are free to fork the code and create their own modified version of the project; users can also create a new project from scratch and work on it to build an alternative. Sounds good? It is!

Except for a teensy issue...
There are simply too many projects *(even those with complex functionalities and code bases)* that duplicate too much work. Just take a look at [Desktop Environments](../linux-desktop-environments) available for Linux users. On the other hand, take a look at Windows, iOS, Android or macOS : There is one desktop environment and that's it *(Android launchers don't count as their changes are only visual and do not have as much scope)*. Choice can be a good thing but choice by itself demands that the user have just the right amount of decision making abilities and understanding. If the user is not smart enough to know what they want, giving them a lot of choice will only make matters worse for them. If the user is unable to make decisions and tends to overthink, they will be unable to settle on any option and this can be problematic. 

So, is the lack of choice a good thing? Not at all! If there is one thing history teaches us, it is that lack of choices lead to toxic environments, dissatisfaction and eventually, a revolution; in the long term anyway, short term lack of choices might not be that big of a problem for the general public. It is the lack of choice that makes slavery bad, it is the lack of choice that is being argued in the Pro-Life vs Pro-Choice debates and it is the lack of choice that is argued against any monopoly. 
> Competition is essential for a healthy economic and social existence and there can be no competition without viable choices.

So how do we proceed from here? I personally believe in the age old philosophy of taking a balanced view to everything in life without aligning oneself to any extreme. For every software category that the FOSS domain has a lot of, it would be best to pick 3-4 of the best implementations that have some sort of distinction between them and urge everyone else to contribute to these. Even if many would decline to do so, some would and that would significantly help make the already good tools much better. Take for example Blender or OBS Studio. They are one of the best open source tools ever made in their respective categories; in fact, they are so good that they are used on every other OS as well. 

**That's what our aim should be. To come together as a community and contribute in making FOSS apps better than all their proprietary competitors, helping spread power to users.**

Let us move forward from the age of a 1000 Linux Distributions, each of which anyway are some permutation of one of the major distros, and let's move forward from the age of a 1000 incomplete apps competing. Let's move towards fewer Linux distros, fewer Desktop Environments and fewer incomplete apps. 

**Let's not have a thousand choices, let's just have fifty. Let's make life easy for new users, indecisive users, and software developers while ensuring viable competition persists.**
