XKCD comics are one of the rare few things that get created once in a lifetime. From being a nerdy and techy blog aimed at the geek crowd to a cultural phenomenon, it has been one of the most highly appreciated pieces of art. It has also been a source of immense enjoyment and happy memories for me and this Progressive Web App is my homaage to the amazing XKCD comics.

I felt that the original [XKCD Website](https://xkcd.com/), while amazing on desktops, is not really mobile friendly. That gave me the idea to provide a substantially better mobile experience for XKCD Comics using my newly learnt web development skills. The result is a Progressive Web App that you can install on your devices. It also provides users with some nifty little features like -
* Like posts and keep them saved in the 'Likes' tab
* Colourful mobile friendly icons, including a dice that shows random numbers for every roll
* Swipe gestures to browse comics
* And a fully responsive design that scales from mobile to desktop with ease

I would love for you to check it out, report bugs by opening issues and create pull requests.
