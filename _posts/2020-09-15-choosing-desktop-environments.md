To be or not to be, that is the question *(Source: [Hamlet, by William Shakespeare](https://amzn.to/3iiipFi))*. This neat statement, despite being quite small, manages to convey through it one of the biggest problems that have plagued humanity through the annals of history : the problem of choice. Without choice, we are bound in our actions; with too much choice, we are stagnant in our actions and bound by confusion. There is no victory in either of these two extremes and the only pragmatic way forward is to choose the middle ground.
