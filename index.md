# Hey, nice to see ya!

At the moment, I don't know what exactly to write here so I'll just let this be a landing page for some projects I have made and like


## XKCD_Alt : An Alternative XKCD Experience

The original [XKCD Website](https://xkcd.com/), while amazing on desktops, is not really mobile friendly. That gave me the idea to provide a substantially better mobile experience for XKCD Comics with my newly learnt web development skills. The result is a Progressive Web App that you can install on your devices with extra goodies like : Store your favourite comics in a convenient likes page, colourful icons, mobile gestures and a fully responsive design.

## 10ify : A Theming Script for Linux users

A lot of people love the Windows workflow but with the privacy of Linux. For all such people, I created a script that sets most settings (including changes to animations) to give you a proper Windows 10 like experience. The project sees regular updates to support the latest versions of the GNOME extensions used. If you don't like the changes, an uninstaller is also provided for you to quikcly revert changes.

## ThreadCleanerBot : A Telegram Bot to rid your group chats of unnecessary status messages

With large Telegram groups, there is always a problem of having too many status update messages (New user added, admin changed, etc). This open-source bot, once added to a group as an admin, will auto-clean all such messages almost instantly to prevent your group chats from being cluttered. Note that this code must be run on a server or a device that is perpetually online for it to work properly (as should be obvious)
